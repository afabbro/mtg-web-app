I play a lot of Magic: The Gathering and being rather unsatisfied by unusuable smartphone helpers that fall short of my needs, I decided to use my Firefox OS hack day demo project as an opportunity to make some. The problems it solves are very simple, which is intentional so that I can explore the use of x-tags in a Firefox OS web app with some miminal examples.

Everything below was from the original template repo that I forked from. Just keeping it around until I get the hang of things. Hold onto 'yer hats!
